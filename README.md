# eui-starter

## React
Using React 17 for now as eui is not yet fully compatible with React 18, see the [roadmap](https://github.com/elastic/eui/issues/6182).

## [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)
Override create-react-app webpack configs [without ejecting](https://medium.com/@timarney/but-i-dont-wanna-eject-3e3da5826e39#.x81bb4kji).
